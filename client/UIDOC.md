## UI/UX Best Practices

### Accessibility

1. **WCAG Compliance**:
   - Add `aria-labels` for all buttons and inputs.
   - Ensure a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text and backgrounds.
2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Trap focus within modals.
   - Enable navigation through dropdowns and forms using the `Tab` key.

### Responsiveness

1. Use **TailwindCSS grid utilities** to create responsive layouts.
2. Ensure key interactions (e.g., search and streaming) are prioritized for mobile users.
3. Breakpoints:
   - **Mobile**: Single-column grid.
   - **Tablet**: Two-column grid.
   - **Desktop**: Three-column grid.

### Consistent Design Language

1. **Typography**:
   - Headings: Use Tailwind's `text-2xl`, `text-xl` for hierarchical clarity.
   - Body text: `text-sm` or `text-base`.
2. **Colors**:
   - Primary: Blue for actionable items.
   - Neutral: Grays for secondary content.
3. **Components**:
   - Use **ShadCN components** for modals, forms, and buttons.

### Advanced Micro-interactions

1. **Hover States**:
   - Slight scaling or shadow effect on hover (e.g., `scale-105`).
2. **Loading Indicators**:
   - Skeleton loaders for API calls.
   - Spinners using Tailwind's `animate-spin`.
